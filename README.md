## Spring MVC Film C.R.U.D. Project

Week 8

#### Team:
Frank Martin
Matt Aldrete

### Overview
Create a full stack Spring MVC web application that allows users to create, update, retrieve, and delete records.


### How to run
Run on server which will put you the home page from there you can choose from the the options listed. Look up film by id, create your own film, delete a film, and update a film. Each link you select will take you to a new page where you will be prompted to input required information.

### Technologies Used
We used MySQL, Gradle, Spring MVC, HTML5, CSS3, Java, JDBC, DAO

### Lessons Learned
Major takeaways we learned was our strategy of coding separately led to many issues. Sometimes we had merge conflicts and because we have varying degrees in proficiency of the skills needed to complete this project this led to missed opportunities to collaborate and learn from each other. In the future we would implement pair programming to increase the learning process improve speed and catch bugs faster.

Another takeaway we learned was being able to create a full stack web application, it was great practice to learn how to map jsps to controllers and implementing Data Access Objects. We struggled with implementing the delete option we tried many different things from changing the routing to trying to fix the jsp and constantly starring at code looking for some misspelled or mismatched word. Ultimately, we were able to collaborate with other groups that helped walk us through out logic to figure out what we had missing.

Much of the learning we did on mapping and spring MVC went by fast and required us to copy and paste some basic code but in doing that we relied to heavy on the template code and ran into the issue of not walking through the steps of mapping and logic we were going to need in order to delete a film.
